# ðŸ‘‹ Hello! My name is Talyta Nogueira.
## Welcome to my Github profile.



**_Always seeking new challenges and continuous learning._**

I have a degree in Design with a specialization in Service Design and multidisciplinary experience in **Graphic Design, Service Design, and Project Management**. My professional journey has allowed me to develop skills in **team integration, project management, client and supplier relations**, as well as **business KPI definition, demand prioritization, and technological support for non-technical audiences**.  

Currently, I am deepening my knowledge in **data analysis** to expand my skill set and drive my career to new horizons.
